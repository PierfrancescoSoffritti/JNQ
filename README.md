# JNQ
JNQ's Not Qa!

JNQ is a library built on top of Node.js, its purpose is to provide a set of abstractions to allow its users to not think about the implementation details of the system while working on its model.
In particular JNQ facilitates reactive programming, an actor does a set of actions as a consequence of receiving an event or message from another actor.
A user of the JNQ library doesnâ€™t care if the actors are all on the same machine and how they communicate, the library takes care of all that.
